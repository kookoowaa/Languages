# Collections

- Collections are available as 1) collections of only the same element  (i.e. IntArray, BooleanArray), and 2) collections of mixture of element (i.e. array)
- From different scope, there are immutable ones like `mapOf` that is similar to the dictionary of python, and of course mutable collections
