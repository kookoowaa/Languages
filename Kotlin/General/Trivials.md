# Trivials

## 1. Increment & Decrement operators

- There is a similar sintax as python for increment & decrement operators: `+= -= *= /= %=`

- There are slinghtly different syntax where it comes before/after variable such as `intNum++ ++intNum`

- When `++` comes before variable, the increment evaluates variable before calculation; when it comes after, the increment is applied after evaluation.
